[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.*

*Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.  Is the distribution uniform?*

Code to generate 1000 random numbers
```python
rand = np.random.random(1000)
```

Code to plot the PMF of the random numbers, showing a uniform distribution.
```python
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth = 0.1)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel = 'random num', ylabel = 'PMF')
```

Code to plot the CDF of the random numbers, showing a uniform distribution.
```python
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random num', ylabel='CDF')
```
